# Secure Sharing of Health Records on Cloud Computing

# Introduction
Most of the time, when people go for a prescription, healthcare person ask them for previous records but people forget to take their past medical records or they have thrown the files unknowingly.  It creates some misleading approach for doctor to process the treatment.

To avoid this kind of misleading approaches, we have designed a secured platform where everyone can keep their medical records for free in a very convenient way. Also hospital can adopt this platform to keep track of admitted patient in their hospital and can also keep the expenses as bill generation in the platform.

# Technologies
1. Cryptography
2. Payment Gateway Integration
3. Speech Recognition
4. Billing System
5. Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
6. Cloud Computing Deployment
7. Curo Card

# Conclusion
We find that electronic health record will help physicians to make evidence based decisions and can predict right treatment process according to their medication history. The community level health status can also be tracked and required campaign can also commenced by the respected government departments. 

To solve the unauthorized access, we have encrypted all the data with latest encryption techniques. No one (except the persons whom the user has granted permission to access the data) can access the stored data of any person.

The hospital can also manage the billing of the individual patient and can collect charges from them through the payment gateways integrated with this site.
